Additions:

* Re-added the list recipe as a crafting recipe, at least until the new assembly table API is finished.

Improvements:

* Pressing F3+T while in the guide book will reload it in-place.
* The config files are saved more often during init, which should help when you need to change a config option just to boot the game but can't because the config file is empty. 

Bug fixes:

* [#4133] The fluid triggers relating to percentage of a tank filled don't recognise gaseous fluids properly.
* Fixed gates sometimes not correctly synchronising the light on the gate when it is first turned on.
* Fixed a few recipes requiring the quarry to be present, rather than itself.
* Fixed GuiScreenBuildCraft not passing on tick()'s to child listeners. Only affects addon developers, as BC itself doesn't use this class for anything yet.
