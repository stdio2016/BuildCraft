Changes:

* Most of the pipe pluggables have been moved from transport to silicon
  * Specifically the gates, light sensor, facades, pulsar, lenses, and filters.
  * This shouldn't cause any issues if you're using at least both transport and silicon already

Improvements:

* Item pipes now send the item all the way into a block, rather than stopping when then item is half-way in.
* [#4062] The gate GUI now allows equal actions to be assigned to trigger slots, and vice versa.
  * Currently this means the following can be converted:
    * Trigger "Redstone Signal is on" <-> Action "Turn On Redstone Signal"
* Added functionality to allow pipe behaviours and flows to change how a pipe's colour is shown
  * Also allows any PipeDefinition to disallow colouring completely.
  * Structure pipes now render their colours as a border, rather than the hidden translucent colour.
  * Added a new option: fluid pipes can switch between translucent colouring, and bordered colouring.
* Added code to the API to allow pipes to render multiple sprites, each with their own colour.
  * See PipeBehaviour.getTextureData(EnumFacing side) and PipeFaceTex to details.
* Added a config option to allow disabling client-side sprite animations.

Ported content:

* The stripes pipe can now extend and retract pipes properly.

Bug fixes:

* Item versions of pipes and paint-brushes didn't render their colours properly.
* The trigger parameters for pipe signals don't work properly.
* [#4031] Tanks that disallow connections via the new canConnectTo(tank) method doesn't render properly.
* [#4067] The heat exchanger sometimes crashes when looking around for adjacent heat exchangers.
* [#4100] The filler GUI doesn't resize itself properly.
* [#4115] The heat exchanger doesn't render fluids in the correct place, nor does it update the model when the multiblock is complete.
* [#4119] Not all pipe upgrade recipes are reversable.
