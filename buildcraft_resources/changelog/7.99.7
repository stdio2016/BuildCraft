Breaking changes:

 * The guide book loads entries differently (A breaking change for addon devs)
   * The contents pages is now loaded from "assets/<domain>/compat/buildcraft/contents.json", rather than "assets/<domain>/guide/contents.json"

Improvements:

 * Guide book entries are loaded from any resource pack, rather than just mod jar files.
 * All loaded contnts pages are listed at the start of the book, along with the mod version
 * [#3773] Facade API has been expanded to give more information.
   * The facade pluggable now implements "buildcraft.api.facades.IFacade" - addon devs can use this for more detailed interaction
   * Many methods and classes have been added to give information about phased facades.
