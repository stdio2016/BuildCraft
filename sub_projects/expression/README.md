Expression library.

## Usage

Most of the source code should be documented. If in doubt refer to the tests for what this project can do.

## Using this in other projects:

Currently this is published in [https://mod-buildcraft.com/maven](https://mod-buildcraft.com/maven) as "buildcraft-libexpression". This uses a different versioning scheme than the rest of buildcraft, so that we are not locked down to the same version and release schedule.

If you are a mod author then it's recommended that you depend on "buildcraft-lib" (the mod) rather than this project directly. However if you don't wish to depend on buildcraft lib itself you can always utalise ForgeGradle's package renaming and shading functionality to embed a particular version of this library directly in a mod. (instructions TODO)

## Building:

This is made of up of 3 source parts: normal, generated, and generator.

The normal source is located under "src/main/java".

The generator source is located under "src/generator/java" and "src/generator/resources". This code doesn't need to be included in any of buildcraft normal builds: it exists solely to generate the generated source code.

The generated source is located under "src/autogen/java" and is generated by a gradle command "gradle generateSources" (executed in "sub_projects/expression").
